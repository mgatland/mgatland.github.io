TIL:
When asked to display Helvetica, Windows will display Arial.
This made me think I had Helvetica installed, and I got really confused when I tried comparing Helvetica and Arial.



=== The Past ===

2013-05-04
[x] on journal pages, put 'matthew gatland' up top, not next/prev

2013-04-24:
[X] style images on games pages
[X] next and previous links above individual journal posts
[X] show a disabled 'next' button instead of 'there is no next post'
[X] journal permalink anchor is now on the date, not the title
	(the title was way too and prominent for something you're not really ever meant to click)
[X] layout changes so that the above makes sense.

2013-04-23:
[X] footers display breadcrumbs, not links to every part of the site.
[X] Journal pages never have a grandiose full title page. They always look like inline posts, under a 'journal' header (which links to the journal homepage).

2013-04-22:
[X] next and previous links (2013-04-22)

earlier:
[x] make <hr> the same color in firefox that it is in chrome
add the games page, with all my games
[x] games page: show title cards and a summary for each game
[X] migrate Adventure
[X] migrate Takedown
[X] connect matthewgatland.com to the new website
[X] custom 404 page
[X] test on OS X 
[X] (fix animations on Safari)

Here are the different types of links, sorted by where they first appear

homepage:
* normal text links (or footer links) - grey background
games:
* link back home - subtle background
* big game button - subtle background, big margins, text does not change color
Writing:
* 'heading with date' link - link to an article, NO background
	only the title links, not the date.
Journal:
* 'subtle' link - the date links to the permalink. Similar to big game button
