Wow, the complexity of my website is exploding.

Here are the different types of links, sorted by where they first appear

homepage:
* normal text links (or footer links) - grey background
games:
* link back home - subtle background
* big game button - subtle background, big margins, text does not change color
Writing:
* 'heading with date' link - link to an article, NO background
	only the title links, not the date.
Journal:
* 'heading with date' v2 - the journal heading links to its permalink
Journal - one post:
* big top heading links back to the journal, NO background

That's six different types of link stylings...
The journal is particularly problematic.
It's not obvious that clicking on the title is a permalink.
Also, that link is too big and prominant, considering you should rarely click it.

Maybe I should have an explicit 'permalink' link (ugly...)
...or maybe I should only have headings on the journal home page - no infinite scroll (aww...)
...or maybe I should make that link more subtle (a different hover color)

[ ] infinite scroll for the journal:

	Load 1 page natively.
	non-js: There's a link to the previous post (as on an individual page)

	js-users:
		hide the next + previous links.
		on scroll, load the next post and insert at the end.

[ ] Remove the footer from:
		Writing posts, maybe
		Games pages, maybe
		Journal posts and the root journal page

I claim that I "make games and talk to people."
	add some evidence that I talk to people

TIL:
When asked to display Helvetica, Windows will display Arial.
This made me think I had Helvetica installed, and I got really confused when I tried comparing Helvetica and Arial.
