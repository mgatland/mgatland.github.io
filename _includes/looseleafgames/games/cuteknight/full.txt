<h1>Cute Knight</h1>

<p>In this role playing game, you help an orphan girl learn a trade, make friends or find romance. Cute Knight has a town full of exciting people and events, as well as a dangerous dungeon to explore. With fifty different endings, you can choose any path you can imagine - princess, dancer, librarian, knight... anything is possible!</p>

<p>At Loose Leaf Games, we play Cute Knight all the time - sometimes when we should be working! We especially like the little, unexpected touches: classmates will introduce themselves after a class, found items can be combined to make new equipment, and special events happen when you play on Halloween or Christmas!</p>
