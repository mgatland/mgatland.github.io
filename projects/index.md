<h3>Pop-Up Arcade</h3>

![Hand-painted laptops at Pop-Up Arcade](/images/pop-up-arcade.jpg){:.w640}

New Zealand's strangest games arcade. Appearing at festivals and in dark corners, we show locally-made games running on hand-painted computers.

Our goal is to bring DIY games out into the community, to get all kinds of people playing and making together.

<h3>Code Club Auckland</h3>

![Teaching Scratch for FutureInTech](/images/workshops-futureintech.jpg)

Each week, 20 high school students come to Code Club Auckland to make cool stuff with computers. I run the club with Orion Health and a team of volunteers.

I also volunteer for other organisations that teach programming at schools.

<h3>The Deadline Club</h3>
