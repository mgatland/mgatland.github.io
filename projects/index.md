<h3>Pop-Up Arcade</h3>

![Pop-Up Arcade](/images/pop-up-arcade.jpg){:.w640}

Sharing digital games with the local community.

Most DIY videogames are only distributed online. Our arcade gives these games a place in the real world.

We paint old computers, put games on them, and take them to festivals.

<h3>Code Club Auckland</h3>

![Teaching Scratch for FutureInTech](/images/workshops-futureintech.jpg)

Each week, 20 high school students come to Code Club Auckland to make cool stuff with computers. I run the club with Orion Health and a team of volunteers.

I also volunteer for other organisations that teach programming at schools.
