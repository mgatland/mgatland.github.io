<h3>Pop-Up Arcade</h3>

![Hand-painted laptops at Pop-Up Arcade](/images/pop-up-arcade.jpg){:.w640}

New Zealand's strangest games arcade. Appearing at festivals and in dark corners, we show locally-made games running on hand-painted computers.

Our goal is to bring DIY games out into the community, to get all kinds of people playing and making together. [Catch our next event.](http://popuparcade.co.nz)

<h3>Tech Education</h3>

![Teaching Scratch for FutureInTech](/images/workshops-futureintech.jpg)

Each week, 20 high school students come to Code Club Auckland to make cool stuff with computers. I started the club with Ruth James from Orion Health and a team of volunteers.

I've designed workshops that teach programming, game making and web technologies for OMG Tech!, Auckland Libraries and FutureInTech.
