<h3>Pop-Up Arcade</h3>

![Hand-painted laptops at Pop-Up Arcade](/images/pop-up-arcade.jpg){:.w640}

New Zealand's strangest games arcade. Appearing at festivals and in dark corners, we show locally-made games running on hand-painted computers.

Our goal is to bring DIY games out into the community, to get all kinds of people playing and making together. [Catch our next event.](http://popuparcade.co.nz)

<h3>Tech Education</h3>

![Teaching Scratch for FutureInTech](/images/workshops-futureintech.jpg)

I started the first Code Club in Auckland, together with Ruth James from Orion Health and a team of volunteers. We teach programming and tech skills to children each week.

I also work with other organsations to teach coding and promote technology careers.

<h3>Talks</h3>

<p><strong>JavaScript is Good Now</strong> <a href="http://www.matthewgatland.com/javascriptisgoodnow/#/">(slides)</a> – NZ&nbsp;GDC&nbsp;2014</p>

<p>Web technologies are changing fast, and JavaScript isn't what it was 6 months ago – especially on iOS. Could 2014 be the first year you can make a decent game in the browser?</p>

<p><strong>A day in the life of a Software Engineer</strong> <a href="http://www.matthewgatland.com/talkforschools2/">(slides)</a> – a careers talk for school students.</p>

<h3>Workshops</h3>

<p><strong>Understanding Game Design</strong> <a href="http://www.matthewgatland.com/game-design-talk/">(slides)</a> – a beginner class, loosely based on Marc LeBlanc's famous GDC workshops. Made for Laneway Learning.</p>

<p><strong>Game Making for Beginners</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfd0Utm7ePI/">(video)</a> – a super-accessible workshop for children as young as nine (and anyone older). I've run it more than 30 times.</p>

<p><strong>The Newsroom</strong> – a rough one-off workshop at <a href="http://gathergather.co.nz/">Gather</a> about how we share critical tasks when under pressure. Participants were challenged to divide a writing and design task between 10 people, so they could "provide 5 person-hours worth of content in 30 minutes".</p>

<h3>Appearances</h3>

<p><strong>Collective Intelligence</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ktMqNnXaQ">(video)</a> - an online panel at Freeplay 2015.</p>
