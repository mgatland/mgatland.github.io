<p>There's something strange going on in Auckland City.</p>

<p>Something paranormal.</p>

<p>I can't talk about it here. They watch the internet - cyberspace is easy for them. It's all illusions and emotions and energy.</p>

<p>The real world is hard for them, and that's the problem. They shouldn't be in the real world - at least, not in large numbers. Not enough to be noticed.</p>

<p>But I did notice.</p>

<p>Print out these instructions, and I'll show how you to see what I can see... and then maybe you can help me stop them. Before it's too late.</p>

<p>(The trail will take around 20 minutes.)</p>
