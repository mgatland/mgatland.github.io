Click on the skull to start, then use the arrow keys to move.

My first flash game, built following the great ‘Avoider Game’ tutorial found at <a href="http://gamedev.michaeljameswilliams.com/2008/09/17/avoider-game-tutorial-1/">Michael J Williams's website</a>.

I had to adapt the tutorial slightly because I was not using the 
Flash editor. I worked solely in FlashDevelop (using the Flex SDK to 
compile).
