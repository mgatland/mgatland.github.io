<p>My desk is covered in good stuff at the moment. Pictured here are the Boys' 
  High &quot;Achiever&quot; bumper stickers that came with my colours awards. 
  a letter telling me I won a $200 speech scholarship, and the last paragraph-and-a-half 
  of a speech I wrote on lateness. Also: A screwdriver. Good, good stuff.</p>
