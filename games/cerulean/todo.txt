Conversation:
[ ] Only talk when not in combat OR when in full health
[ ] only talk when Anna and Justin are together
[ ] put break-lines between disjointed chats when they're in the same room
[ ] make recent chats flash? it's hard to follow conversations sometimes.



[ ] Sound effect upon getting the green collector item

to do:
[ ] The world has 9 regions. Each has different enemies and room sizes.
[ ] the North, South, East and West regions are unlocked until the player does something
[ ] the 4 corner regions are each individually locked.

So our player story is: unlock the NSEW, then unlock each of the 4 corners.

Intro movie

[ ] spawn build areas in some rooms

[ ] let the player build stuff on 'build areas' (empty green boxes)
	stuff like: teleporters, temporary powerups, currency gatherers
	powerups to expand into the other 8 regions.

[ ] late game, let the player create their own build areas anywhere

[ ] Handle player collecting items in unexpected order

[ ] some enemies move between rooms, chasing the player from up to 5 rooms away.
[ ] rooms with only one door are special (boss rooms? treasure rooms?)
[ ] some rooms are randomly just treasure rooms
[ ] much more enemy diversity

Presentation:
[ ] add a fancy glow\blur effect
[ ] draw everything in vector lines instead of blocks of color
[ ] make rooms look like faces?
[ ] stun gun sound effect

Make the first set of rooms very easy.

[ ] make pressing keyboard keys not make sounds any more!

[x] eyes of devotion story point

2013-12-18

[x] Better charging effect
[x] start on room types - rooms far from the start are red instead of green.

2013-09-07

[x] don't draw those blue debug dots
[x] Anna's weapons flicker green\black, not green\red (red is only for dangerous things)
[x] try putting text inside the rooms? Yes. I am keeping this.
[x] improve conversation engine

Conversation should only appear in non-combat situations, when Anna and Justin are together (unless it's special solo conversation)

[x] companion arrives after you explore 7 rooms
[x] trigger conversation when you meet the companion, and there are no enemies in the current room
[x]	Activate the artifact finder at the end of that conversation.	

[x] Artifact - the green stuff collector.

[x] stun gun visual effect - a beam of green bubbles
[x] speed up loading.
	I used a map instead of iterating over 3000 rooms, but it barely helped - until I used numbers instead of strings as keys to the map. Then it really helped. 3000 ms down to 750 ms.

[x]	There is a companion who follows the player
	[x] companion can move between rooms
	[x] ...intelligently
	[x] Can freeze one enemy temporarily

[x] switch to WebGL graphics
	fun! I copy-pasted a lot of code I don't understand... but it's working, 100% like it did before.
	Everything is in webGL except the text, which is on a overlaid on a transparent canvas.
	I replaced the canvas noise effect with a noise shader effect. *Learning about shaders*

[x] add synth sounds. Lots of work on the sounds.

[x] sleep...

[x] Add the intro sequence
	[x] message system to display your chat with Jessica
	[x] collectable artefact
	[x] your attack only works when you have the attack artefact
	[x] the artefact triggers part 2 of the story:
		- screen shakes, the red lines appear. You can now go through doorways.

[X] clean shots in a room when the player leaves that room
	I don't like the feel of this (arbitrarily resetting world state), but it was an easy way to
	prevent players getting a room into an unwinnable state. Better would be to keep updating shots
	after the player leaves the room -- enemies stop firing so the shots will all explode after a few seconds. But currently I can't update rooms that the player isn't in.
