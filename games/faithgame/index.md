[Perform the ritual](http://faithgame.herokuapp.com) or [contemplate the canon](http://faithgame.herokuapp.com/gallery.html)

Faithgame is a game-making ritual. By following strict constraints, our games become closer to perfection -- as do we.

We started by taking the source code from the brilliant but unorthodox game making tool [flickgame](http://www.flickgame.org/). We purified the tool, for example by correcting its irregular aspect ratio to a perfect square.

We soon divined that a perfect game has 10 pages, is created in silence, and is published in secret. We continued to modify the tool to help users perform the game-making ritual canonically.

Faithgame was exhibited at [tinypalace](http://tinypalace.de/), an alternative games festival in Kassel, Germany.
