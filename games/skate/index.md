Skate is a one-week prototype skating game, inspired by Zineth and Jet Set Radio.

It's all about going fast and feeling good.

Most of my games revolve around exploring, making progress, following a story, or earning points. For Skate, I wanted to focus on the moment-to-moment feeling of the game, instead of those longer-term goals.
