An unfinished bullet-hell MMO.

It's basically a clone of the popular game Realm of the Mad God. I spent a lot of time working on a complicated lag-compensation system that means you can still shoot and dodge precisely even on a laggy connection.

I probably should have spent less time on that, and focused on making it fun instead. There isn't much to do in the game â€“ you can go up levels and find a few different enemy types but that's about it. I think it could be really interesting with a bit more content.

I hope you enjoy the game!

_This is the first game released with the support of my [anti-patreons](/anti-patreon)._
