Made for Ludum Dare 15.

It’s a cave flyer so you fly in a cave. Perhaps you’ve played one before? This one is blue.

Controls:

* Click on the game (above) to give it focus.
* arrow keys to thrust and rotate
* spacebar to shoot
* [a], [r], [t] to buy upgrades when parked on the landing pad.

This is very unfinished but should be playable. You can’t win, 
though.

More info at the [Ludum Dare page.](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview&uid=1113)

Made with:

* FlashDevelop &amp; Flex 3 SDK<br>
* sfxr (and Audacity to convert wavs to to mp3)<br>
* Paint.net

I’m new to ActionScript so I looked at and stole from lots of 
tutorials – there are comments in the source where I did this.

This has been tweaked since the original Ludum Dare release, mainly to make it easier.
