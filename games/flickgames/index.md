flickgame is a quick game creation tool by Increpare. I like it a lot because it's so constrained, you can make games very quickly.

Here is a flickgame I made on my own:

[Good Shepherd](good-shepherd/)

Here is a flickgame I made with Kate Pike, Alice Gatland and Sergio Cornaga. We made it in one night, each taking one 20 minute turn to add 4 pages.

Protip: In flickgames, you progress by clicking on different colours. Your pointer will change from an arrow to a finger when it's over a colour that you can click on.
