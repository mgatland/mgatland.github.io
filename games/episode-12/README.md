Chapter 12 of Chain Game 2
=========

There are 2 ways to release this.

1. on my Jekyll website
2. as a node-webkit application. To release that:
-A: Delete the --- preamble --- and {% include analytics.html %} lines from index.html
-B: put all the files in the same folder as node-webkit
-C: rename the nw.js exe file to chapter12.exe
-D: zip it up. There's your release /o/
