TakeDown is a 2D game of action and strategy, taking elements from traditional 
arcade style games and modern, story driven strategy games. You take on the 
role of a 'Peacekeeper', the most elite soldier the world has ever seen. You 
are the first and final fighting force to protect the fabric of society from 
those that seek to destroy it.

That's how I described it in 2002, anyway. I was 16 years old and thought TakeDown was my magnum opus.

It's a top town, tile-based shooter with something new in every mission. There's no proper ending, but if you manage to find your friend you should consider yourself a winner. (The missions after that are incomplete.)

I stopped work on TakeDown in the middle of some big AI changes, which means this version of the game has some temporary voice recordings that will now be permanent, and the AI can be exploited a bit on some levels. (The AI changes were around making the enemies react to and investigate sounds.)

OK, enough excuses. If you want to play my magnum opus, click on the link at the top of the page.
