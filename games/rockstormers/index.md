Rockstormers was a 1-day game I made during my "100 days" project. This version, Rockstormers 2, adds 4 player support, sound effects, and a number of tweaks to the gameplay.

Race your friends to catch the crystal in this local multiplayer space race! Inspired by [Comet Busters](https://archive.org/details/CometBusters14Image) and [Comet Bumper](https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/ultimate-cat-drift-comet-bumpers-bananacontra).

_This is the seventh game released with the support of my [anti-patrons](/anti-patreon)._
