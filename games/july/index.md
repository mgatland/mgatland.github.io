A 90s-style shooter influenced by Eye of Horus, Commander Keen, and me trying to make a game 'about something'.

Made during Kiwijam 2019 and changed a bit afterwards.

_This is the fourth game released with the support of my [anti-patrons](/anti-patreon)._

2024-01-05 update: I've removed the slightly multiplayer aspect of this game. See more details on the <a href="./flap/">Flappy World</a> page.
