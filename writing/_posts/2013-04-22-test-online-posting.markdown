This is just a test to see if I can update the website from online, without using any files on my file system.

That's the dream. For me, "the cloud" is about websites that talk to each other directly. When I change my Gravatar avatar and Github updates automatically, that's "cloud." When I have to manually update my avatar, but I can do it by passing a link to my avatar on another website, that's kind of cloudy. When I have to download my avatar from Gravatar, save it to my Desktop, then upload it again into Github, that's broken. Nothing should touch my file system.

Anyway, here I am, updating my blog from [prose.io](http://prose.io) -- let's see if it works.
