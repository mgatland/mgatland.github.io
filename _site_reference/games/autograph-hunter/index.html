    	<h2>Autograph Hunter</h2>
    	<div class="subtle">February&nbsp;07,&nbsp;2015</div>
    </div>
    <p>A non-digital game created for the <a href="http://wildstreets.weebly.com">Wild Streets</a> festival in February 2015.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Famous celebrities are hiding around the park. Their autographs are worth a lot of money – but they won’t sign for just anyone! Use your wits, charm and outrageous lies to get the autographs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>

<p>Note: You will need to create your own version of the Celeb Guide with photos of your actual actors. The copy here is just for reference.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="autograph-hunter-celeb-guide.pdf">Celeb Guide</a> – print one copy per expected player.</li>
  <li><a href="autograph-hunter-actors-notes.pdf">Actors’ notes</a> – print one copy, to read through with the actors.</li>
  <li>4 pens.</li>
  <li>Props: book, butterfly net, mug, shovel.</li>
  <li>Prizes: I used small plastic diamonds.</li>
  <li>Five staff in total: four ‘celebs’ plus the host.</li>
  <li>A large play area like a park or convention.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>The game runs for a fixed period of time (Fom 30 minutes to 3 hours, or as long as your cast can stand!) Players can start and finish at any time during this period. They don’t need to be there at the start.</p>

<p>Four actors play the famous celebrities. They should each read the Celeb Guide, and then the Actor’s Notes for their character.</p>

<p>Each is given a pen and their character’s prop (book, mug, butterfly net or shovel.) They position themselves around the play area. They may move around during the game.</p>

<p>The host positions themself at the information desk or starting area for the game. The host has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enough copies of the Celeb Guide for every potential player.</li>
  <li>A bag of rewards for the winners. I used plastic gems.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-celebs">The Celebs</h3>

<p>Players will approach the celebrity and try to get their autograph.</p>

<p>Each celebrity has different rules about who they’ll give the autograph to. Try to help the player figure out what you want, without being too obvious.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="autograph-hunter-actors-notes.pdf">actors’ notes</a> for more detail on the specific characters.</p>

<h3 id="the-hosts-role">The Host’s Role</h3>

<p>When players approach, the host says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi! Around this park are four super-famous celebrities. You may not have heard of them, but their autographs are worth a lot of cash! The problem is, they know I’m an Autograph Hunter and they won’t sign for me. They won’t even talk to me! That’s where you come in.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>They don’t know who you are, so you can trick them! Here is some info about each celebrity, that will help you work out how. You may need to lie - you may need to pretend to be someone else, to get the signuature.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can get all four autographs, I’ll give you a fantastic prize!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The players can collect the signatures on the back of their Celeb Guide. (If they ask about pens, explain that “Don’t worry. Celebrities always carry their own pens.”)</p>

<p>When players return with all the signatures:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you so much! I’ll sell these on the black market. Here’s your reward: A fake diamond. It’s not really worth anything, but I figure, you’re so good at tricking people, you’ll probably be able to get a good price for it. Thanks for your help!</p>
</blockquote>
