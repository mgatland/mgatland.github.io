<p>This is the floor beside my desk. You can see a history book on top of a packet 
  of photography paper. There is an alarm clock under some miscellaneous scraps, 
  and beside some rubbish I collected when we cleaned the photography room. The 
  white book is a book of poetry and the bag it's in has another book of poetry 
  inside it, as well as the complete works of Shakespeare. </p>
<p>Right at your feet is my speech folder. On the end of it are some tickets but 
  you can't read them from this far away.</p>
