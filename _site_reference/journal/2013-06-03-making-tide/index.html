    <p><a href="/games/tide/">Tide</a> is my second game prototype.</p>

<p>I choose the style and concept in the first few hours:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid expanding badness.</li>
  <li>Set off mines to blow holes in the badness.</li>
  <li>It’s a single screen game.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Problem 1</em>: It wasn’t fun. Your actions didn’t matter until the whole screen was almost flooded, so you spent the start of the game just waiting around.</p>

<p>Working on a game that isn’t fun isn’t fun. I was stressed!</p>

<p>The fix was to change the goal. Instead of staying alive, the goal became to grab as many mines as possible.</p>

<p>This made it exciting. You’re constantly deciding which mine to go for next, and trying to get there as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><em>Problem 2</em>: I wasn’t sure how to add level progression.</p>

<p>This had a really obvious solution, I just didn’t see it until Joshua pointed it out: start with one mine, and make each level have one more than the last. That was perfect.</p>

<p>With that, the gameplay was finished. I added animations, sound, music, and polish.</p>

<h3 id="things-that-went-well">Things that went well</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Choosing a very simple concept and refining it.</li>
  <li>The game feels good. It’s fast-paced and has interesting choices.</li>
  <li>I love the sound and music. This is my first game with sound since 2011.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-to-change">Things to change</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The dots that show your current level are not easy to understand.</li>
  <li>There’s no goal or surprise to work towards.</li>
  <li>No touch controls (so when Megan tried it on her phone, it didn’t work).</li>
  <li>Some levels seem to be impossible. This is especially unfair since you only have one life.</li>
</ul>
