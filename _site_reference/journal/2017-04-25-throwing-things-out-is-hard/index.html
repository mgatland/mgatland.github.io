    	<h2>Throwing Things Out is Hard</h2>
    	<div class="subtle">April&nbsp;25,&nbsp;2017</div>
    </div>
    <p>I’ve always wanted to make games with custom hardware – games like Robin Baumgarten’s Line Wobbler or Flat Earth Games’ Objects in Space.</p>

<p><img src="/journal/images/2017-04-25-line-wobbler.jpg" alt="Line Wobbler"></p>
<div class="caption">Line Wobbler, in a photo that does not do it justice</div>

<p>Because I’ve always wanted to do this, I’ve always kept things that I thought would be useful: old computers, hard drives, power adaptors for long-lost devices, joysticks, broken game controllers, spare speakers, old keyboards.</p>

<p>This is aspirational hoarding. I keep these things not because I’ve ever needed them, but because I would like to be the kind of person who needs them.</p>

<p><em>I don’t make hardware games.</em></p>

<p>Tonight I’m trying to throw it all out.</p>

<p>My brain fights me every step of the way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What if I get rid of this cable, then find out 6 months later that I need one? They’re overpriced at every store.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This old hard drive still works. It doesn’t hold as much as a new one, but it would be perfect if I was building a special-purpose PC for some kind of project.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe I’ll make a location-specific game where every player needs earphones. Having these 5 pairs ready to go is a great start!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My life has felt unfocused this year, and I think it will help if I’m more clear about what I’m not. I’m not a hardware hacker. I might become one – I’ve been many things! – but I’m not one today. I should not collect parts for an imagined future.</p>
