    <p>Whoops, these were supposed to be weekly. It’s been a month since the last one. That’s OK.</p>

<p>I’m coming up to the end of a three-week holiday. I didn’t do much except sleep, and that’s OK too.</p>

<p>The best thing about this holiday is that I stopped thinking about work. I was thinking about work a lot. I would often wake up in the middle of the night and send myself an email because I had an Important Work Thought.</p>

<p>I don’t want to do that any more. 2021: the year of not working as much.</p>

<hr />

<p>I listened to an episode of the <a href="https://thespelunkyshowlike.libsyn.com/">Eggplant podcast</a> where they interviewed Chevy Ray Johnston about his magic school game Ikenfell. I like magic school settings and have an unfinished magic school game of my own, so I was keen to listen.</p>

<p>It’s a great interview, with some interesting ideas on how to balance special abilities vs normal damage-dealing attacks. But most importantly, Chevy recommended two magic school stories: the novel <a href="https://www.rainbowrowell.com/carry-on">Carry On</a> and the web series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbvYWjKFvS5rX2yv-k5AJ8oxPoZ9zHcpe">Carmilla</a>. I started watching the web series today. It’s fun!</p>

<hr />

<p>I watched a lot of TV this year. If I’m going to continue watching a lot of TV, I wonder if I can make better choices about what to watch.</p>

<p>A lot of the shows I watch don’t really give me much in return for my time. I watched every episode of Star Trek: Discovery and I don’t remember any episode that “spoke to me” or made me feel something. Same with Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, which dropped a new season yesterday. I’m going to watch it anyway, but I’m not sure why?</p>

<p>Maybe trying to make my TV habits <em>enriching</em> is missing the point. I don’t know. I don’t want to overthink my hobbies and turn them into jobs. But I also don’t want to spend a thousand hours watching bad TV if watching good TV would leave me feeling better.</p>
