    <p>Hey! I haven’t released a game for a while. What did I do all month?</p>

<h3 id="the-pop-up-games-arcade">The Pop-Up Games Arcade</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Started planning a day-long pop-up event.</li>
  <li>Found a cool venue.</li>
  <li>Bought laptops from facebook friends and TradeMe sellers.</li>
  <li>Painted a laptop! I was scared at first, but I grew braver.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="turned-down-a-job">Turned down a job</h3>

<p>A lecturer offered me some contract work, building a game for her and the university. This was a great opportunity, but was it right for me?</p>

<!--
Making some money from game dev would be great. I haven't earned any money since I quit my day job.

And having a client would force me back into good work habits, like waking up before midday :/

On the other hand, all the game developers I know who do contract work seem to wish that they didn't. If they could afford to work on their own IP, they would.
-->

<p>At Webstock this year, Jim Coudal said “fire your clients!” His company fired its clients one-by-one until there were none left. Now they work only own their own projects.</p>

<p>I can already afford to work on my own projects, which is what I really want to do. Taking on a client is not a step towards that goal.</p>

<!--
And while it might help me develop good working habits, it's also going to occupy my time for many months until the contract is over.-->

<p>In the end, I turned down the job — recommending some friends instead.</p>

<h3 id="other-things">Other things</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Joined a creative community called Scribble, and helped decorate a nightclub for an event. I was brought on board to help with software, but ended up cutting out <a href="http://www.1885.co.nz/images/uploads/gallery/TTT7.jpg">cardboard triangles</a> — a refreshing change from my usual work.</li>
  <li>Went to the first KiwiJam game jam. My favourite game was <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/action/pianocalypse-blasphemous-resurrection/17323/">Pianocalypse: Blasphemous Resurrection</a>.</li>
  <li>Saw my sister’s first improv performance!</li>
  <li>Saw the <a href="http://100daysproject.co.nz/about">100 Days Project</a> exhibition. It was inspirational seeing so many proud creatives with their work.</li>
  <li>Taught web development at another <a href="http://gathergather.co.nz/workshops/for-schools/">Gather workshop</a>, this time at Westlake Girls High School. At the end of the day, the students uploaded their websites to Neocities and linked to each other. This was super-fun, and reminded me of the websites I was making <a href="http://www.geocities.ws/dragonflymatthew/index2.htm">when I was their age</a>.</li>
</ul>
