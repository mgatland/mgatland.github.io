    <p>Things happening in my life:</p>

<h3 id="game-number-four">Game Number Four</h3>

<p>My fourth one-week game was a collaboration with Jonathan, who was taking a break from his work on Path of Exile.</p>

<p>The game’s not quite ready to release, but here is a screenshot:</p>

<p><img src="/journal/images/2013-07-08-network-game.png" alt="Game number 4"></p>

<p>Coming soon!</p>

<h3 id="end-of-deadline-club">End of Deadline Club.</h3>

<p>The Deadline Club was a weekly meeting where people worked on personal projects. I ran the club with Alice Gatland (my sister), and sometimes Helen Durrant and Amie Holman.</p>

<p>We decided to shut down the club, and focus our time and attention on to other projects.</p>

<p>It was the first time I’ve organised a regular event, and I learned a lot. We had 20 meetings in total. I’m a little sad to see it end, but definitely ready to move on to something new.</p>

<h3 id="winter-of-code">Winter of Code</h3>

<p>In the BizDojo Co.Space (the same venue we used for the Deadline Club) there’s a new table set up with six computers. Here, Stephen McIntyre is leading a team of programmers and artists to make a game.</p>

<p>The project happens during the break between semesters at the Media Design School, so that the MDS students are on holiday and can participate.</p>

<p>I love the idea. I stopped in to see how they were going, and everyone on the team seemed excited and motivated.</p>

<p>I would like to run something similar for myself some day – maybe targeting students from the University of Auckland instead.</p>
