    <p>I showed Space Protector at Armageddon last weekend.</p>

<p><img src="/journal/images/2014-10-26-armageddon-booth.jpg" alt="Space Protector booth at Armageddon" /></p>

<p>The booth and TV were provided for free by the <abbr title="New Zealand Game Developer's Association">NZGDA</abbr>. All I had to do was turn up with laptop, controller and HDMI cable. It was a great chance to get the game in front of a lot of people.</p>

<p>About 150 people played.</p>

<p><a href="/journal/2014-09-29-jump-and-shoot/">Last time</a>, many players didn’t realise that you could shoot. It was good to see that the new level design fixes that problem.</p>

<p>There is still a serious usabilty problem, though. This time, it’s around jumping.</p>

<h3 id="the-twelve-percent">The Twelve Percent</h3>

<p>In Space Protector, you jump higher by holding down the jump button for longer.</p>

<p>About 12% of players didn’t work out how to do this. They got stuck in pits, frantically tapping the jump button. They’d try a double jump. They’d try a running jump. They’d try facing away from the wall and jumping backwards towards it.</p>

<p>In the worst scenario, they did a high jump but misunderstood what caused it. Later, they tried repeating the move and it didn’t work.</p>

<p>This made the controls feel random. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t. These players became frustrated and gave up.</p>

<h3 id="you-can-fly">“You can fly?”</h3>

<p>Holding a button to jump higher was common in old platform games, but it’s not actually intuitive.</p>

<p>When one young player figured it out, he exclaimed: “Oh, you can fly?” It’s more like how a jetpack works than how jumping works.</p>

<p>I would like to fix the problem through level design, like I did with shooting, but it might not be possible. The level can show that you need to jump, but it can’t show that you need to <em>hold down a button</em>. Buttons are an out-of-game concept.</p>

<p>I could give up, and just change the controls to use double jump, but I don’t really want to. I like the game the way it is!</p>

<p>I might have to resort to a tutorial message. “Hold down the jump button to jump higher!” It’s lazy design, but it will work. I can probably make it so that only the 12% of players who need the message will see it.</p>

<h3 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h3>

<p>Most people enjoyed the game. Experts raced through the levels, reading the situations and avoiding the traps. Beginners slowly stumbled through, dying a lot, but still having fun and enjoying it.</p>

<p>Level 2 has a particularly difficult room. Some young children gave up at this point, but most people found it hilarious – especially groups playing together – so I will keep it.</p>

<p>A few children looked like they’d never played an action game before. This was really cool, because they had no “gamer knowledge” and I could see if the game was understandable on its own.</p>

<h3 id="next-time">Next time</h3>

<p>Next time I’ll try to have more things ready to test. With 150 players, I could have tested a dozen different levels if I had them ready to go.</p>

<p>Ideally, I’d have a way to update the demo without having to quit to desktop and run console commands. (It looks unprofessional.) That would let me update levels as I found problems, and make several revisions over the weekend.</p>
