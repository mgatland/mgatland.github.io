    <p>This week’s game did not go well.</p>

<p>I wanted to make a first person shooter, using Unity, for the <a href="http://7dfps.com/">7DFPS</a> game jam.</p>

<p>First I wanted to remake the wonderful indie game <em>Inago Rage</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/journal/images/2013-08-17-inago-rage.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Inago Rage"></p>

<p>Later on, I tried to build a world that looked like this drawing by Yakov Chernikhov:</p>

<p><img src="/journal/images/2013-08-17-yakov-chernikhov-drawing.jpg" alt="One of Yakov Chernikhov's drawings, showing buildings made out of gridlines"></p>

<p>But I didn’t succeed with either plan. Things went wrong:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I started late in the week, and was too ambitious.</li>
  <li>I used my Macbook, but found it hard to do 3D work on a small screen with no mouse.</li>
  <li>I chose to generate the geometry using code, instead of modelling it by hand. I thought it would be faster, but it was slower even after a day working on the generation tools.</li>
  <li>Unity’s first person movement doesn’t feel right to me. I spent time tweaking it, but didn’t know exactly what was wrong, so didn’t know how to fix it.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Apart from the game, I had a nice week. Some good chats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two of my old university classmates quit their day jobs to go contracting. They say it’s much better – better pay, less politics, and more interesting work.</li>
  <li>I went to a meeting of the Scribble creative community. We talked about Constructivism, photo booths and word puzzles.</li>
  <li>I went to a meeting of the Distiller entrepreneurial community. We talked about meeting customers, disputes with co-founders, and web app frameworks.</li>
</ul>

<p>I always appreciate seeing different perspectives. I’d like to start a startup – or go contracting – or build a creative community around game development.</p>

<p>To have nothing to release this week is depressing, though. I’m going to take the weekend off and think about what to do next.</p>
