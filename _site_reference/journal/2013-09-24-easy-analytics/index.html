    <p>Tide was mentioned on <a href="http://indiegames.com/2013/09/browser_pick_tide.html">indiegames.com</a>. The link brought a few hundred visitors, which is more than I’ve ever had before.</p>

<p><img src="/journal/images/2013-09-30-site-traffic.png" alt="Visits increase from about zero per day to nearly 300 on September 19."></p>

<p>I wanted to see what these players were doing in the game, so I added some event tracking code. I recorded:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each time the game starts.</li>
  <li>Each time a new level starts (except level 1).</li>
  <li>Each time the player loses.</li>
  <li>Each time the player restarts, after losing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-results">The results</h3>

<p><img src="/journal/images/2013-09-30-tide-overview.png" alt="Screenshot of data discussed below"></p>

<p>The Unique Events column only counts one event of each type from each device. Someone who starts the game many times will only be counted once in that column.</p>

<ul>
  <li>473 people started the game.</li>
  <li>438 (93%) finished at least one level.</li>
  <li>Only 375 (79%) ever lost. The others must have quit before they lost.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last result surprised me. I thought everyone would keep playing until they lost at least once.</p>

<p>The next image shows how many times each level was played.</p>

<p><img src="/journal/images/2013-09-30-tide-level-stats.png" alt="Level 2 was reached 738 times. The numbers drop off for higher levels. Level 16 and 17 were only reached once."></p>

<p>(Ignore the percentages on this chart and the next one, they are not meaningful.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first level was played 738 times.</li>
  <li>Higher levels were reached fewer times.</li>
  <li>The highest level ever reached was level 17.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next image shows how many players restarted after losing.</p>

<p><img src="/journal/images/2013-09-30-tide-restart-stats.png" alt="There were 203 restarts after losing once, 83 after losing twice, 33 after losing 3 times. The numbers decrease rapidly."></p>

<p>This event is recorded if a player restarts after losing a game. The number on the left is the number of times they have already played.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most players didn’t restart at all.</li>
  <li>203 (43%) restarted after their first game.</li>
  <li>Far fewer players restarted after subsequent games.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>

<p>I thought Tide was a hard, arcade style game that people would replay to try to improve their high score.</p>

<p>That is not happening. Most people only play once.</p>

<p>If players only want to play once, maybe I should make Tide progress more like a modern-style game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you lose, you can continue from the current level instead of restarting the whole game.</li>
  <li>There is a limited number of levels.</li>
  <li>Levels are hand-made, not random, and more interesting.</li>
  <li>When you finish all the levels you get a nice victory screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, I could encourage replays by making Tide a better arcade-style game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make it much harder, so beginners lose in the first few seconds.</li>
  <li>Show the player’s score more clearly.</li>
  <li>Have a high score table.</li>
</ul>
