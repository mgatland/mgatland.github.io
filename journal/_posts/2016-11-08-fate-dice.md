Fate is a tabletop Roleplaying game (like Dungeons and Dragons) with more emphasis on storytelling and less on simulation.

It uses special D6 dice that have two pluses, two minuses, and two blank faces.

You can buy these online, but if you're in a hurry (or on a budget) you can draw over some normal dice instead.

The recommended technique is called [Connect the Dots](http://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/other-dice), where you connect the dots on a standard dice to form pluses, minuses and zeros.

However, this results in diagonal pluses and minuses that I think are too confusing. (The plus looks like a cross, instead of a plus.) I much prefer to colour in the whole dice _except_ the symbols, using this pattern:

* 6: minus
* 5: blank
* 4: plus
* 3: blank
* 2: plus
* 1: minus (there will be a dot in the middle of the minus)

For first time players, it's important that the system is easy to understand -- any confusion may discourage them. This die isn't pretty, but it is understandable.
