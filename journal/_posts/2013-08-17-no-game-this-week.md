This week's game did not go well.

I wanted to make a first person shooter, using Unity, for the [7DFPS](http://7dfps.com/) game jam.

First I wanted to remake the wonderful indie game _Inago Rage_.

Later on, I tried to build a world that looked like this drawing by Yakov Chernikhov:

But I didn't succeed with either plan. Things went wrong:

* I started late in the week, and was too ambitious.
* I used my Macbook, but found it hard to do 3D work on a small screen with no mouse.
* I chose to generate the geometry using code, instead of modelling it by hand. I thought it would be faster, but it was slower even after a day working on the generation tools.
* Unity's first person movement doesn't feel right to me. I spent time tweaking it, but didn't know exactly what was wrong, so didn't know how to fix it.

* * *

Apart from the game, I had a nice week. Some good chats:

* Two of my old university classmates quit their day jobs to go contracting. They say it's much better -- better pay, less politics, and more interesting work. 
* I went to a meeting of the Scribble creative community. We talked about Constructivism, photo booths and word puzzles.
* I went to a meeting of the Distiller entrepreneurial community. We talked about meeting customers, disputes with co-founders, and web app frameworks.

I always appreciate seeing different perspectives. I'd like to start a startup -- or go contracting -- or build a creative community around game development.

To have nothing to release this week is depressing, though. I'm going to take the weekend off and think about what to do next.
