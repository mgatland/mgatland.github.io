Today I booked travel and a ticket for a conference. It was reasonably expensive -- $800 plus opportunities -- and I felt some anxiety as I made the commitment. _Is this the right place to spend my energy and money?_

I can best answer that question by looking at my goals. So, as a reference for next time, here's what I'm working towards with my life:

* Make a great game
* Build a community of players
* Talk at a conference
* Show my work in an exhibition
* Run a scavenger hunt
* Run an ongoing, real-world game
* Go on a date
* Own a space -- like a shop or a games arcade
* &#10003; Teach programming to children
* Teach more programming to more children
* &#10003; Quit my job
* Be financially stable i.e. earn more than I spend
* Be part of a great team
* Build a team that works for profit share
* Build a team and pay them real money
