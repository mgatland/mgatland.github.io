A ran a tabletop RPG campaign last year. I've been a player in a game for a while, but this was my first time as Game Master and I had some ideas to test.

* I wanted a short campaign. Free evenings are precious, and I don't want to give up one of my weeknights forever. I decided the campaign would be exactly five sessions long.
* I like when the story advances super-fast. I'd been watching the Vampire Diaries (TVD), and loved the show's rapid pace. TVD will run though a season's worth of plot in a few episodes. I wanted the game to feel like that.
* Minimal planning. I like improvising and don't like world-building, so I wanted to make everything up on the spot but make it look like I'd planned it all from the start.
* I wanted the players to have total freedom - like in Skyrim (or any Elder Scrolls video game). If they want to go bowling instead of saving the world, let them.

### Background

We used [Fate Accelerated](http://fate-srd.com/fate-accelerated-fae-menu){:target="_blank"} as the game system. I asked the players to imagine they were characters on a TV show. In real life, and in many games, it matters exactly how much money you have. But on TV, a character can always afford something unless there's a plot or character reason that they can't. I wanted everyone to think on this narrative level, instead of worrying about exact details.

I called our sessions "episodes" and the campaign a "season". I like to think this helped the players get engaged, since TV is something we could all relate to.

### An Evil Plot Fails

In the first episode, the players created their characters. We made up the rough outline of the game world (using a few ideas I'd prepared ahead of time) and then started playing.

It was incredibly exciting and difficult to make things up as quickly as the players required them. After that, I knew I needed to do some preparation before next time.

I'd read that a good way to plan a game, while still giving players lots of freedom, is to plan out what the villains would do if the players didn't stop them. You don't plan any specific scenes or conversations. You just work out what the villains are trying to do, and how it would affect the players and the world.

So I put together an evil plot, tying in events from the messy pilot episode and a few player character backstories. It was very simple: the villain wanted to find three magical artifacts to summon a demon.

I imagined a story where the heroes would fail to stop villains every time, until the final confrontation where they finally save the day. That's how stories work in The Vampire Diaries.

Unfortunately, the players stopped the villains from getting the first artifact. And then they destroyed the second one! This early success derailed the entire evil plot.

Wow.

I never imagined the story would go this way. I should have, because RPG heroes always win! But I'd been watching too much TVD.

Once I mentally recovered, I course-corrected: the villains made alternative plans. And now they're angry! The tension can still rise towards Act 3, even if the heroes have been winning.

But these changes complicated the plot. I knew what the villains would do next, but the players didn't. And they didn't know how to find out.

The game would have run a lot better if it was the players themselves who were looking for three artifacts. That would give them direction and purpose. Instead, they floundered around, not knowing what to say to get me to tell them what to do next. And I felt stuck too, because the questions they were asking were often so far off that I couldn't think of any answer that was helpful.

_Next time:_ give the heroes clear direction, even if they have the freedom to ignore it. And be prepared for the players to win or lose any encounter.

### Problems with Pace

I set up the evil plot to develop over a week of in-game time, which I hoped would span the five episodes of our show.

This was a mistake. Spreading the evil plan over time slowed the story.

For example, I wanted to have the villains do something evil at a concert on Saturday, but I just couldn't get to Saturday fast enough!

This left the players hanging around with no evil actions to react to. I eventually dealt with this in-universe by forcing the baddies to act faster and abandon their original Saturday concert scheme. This fix had side-effects, though: again, the plot grew more complicated, and the players were confused because they still thought the concert would become relevant. I'd spent a lot of energy foreshadowing the concert, and the players were invested in it too. All that energy went nowhere and was wasted.

Looking back, I was too eager to introduce an epic, multi-episode storyline. I should have run a few [one-episode stories](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek){:target="_blank"} to get comfortable with my pacing before I tried anything longer.

### Pilots are Always Bad

The first episode, which started immediately after character creation, was a mess.

I made snap decisions that haunted me for the rest of the season. The worst was when I accidentally said one of the baddies was working for the good secret organisation, instead of the evil one. I spent a lot of energy over the rest of the series trying to explain how a good agent had turned bad. The truth was: a player asked me who they worked for, we'd only just named the groups, and in the heat of the moment I said the wrong name. Oops.

Despite the disasters, having the pilot episode right after character creation was the right choice. Seeing what went wrong showed me exactly what I needed to plan for for next time. Without the pilot, I may have wasted hours on planning I didn't need.

### Player Agency

Some GMs give players out-of-character influence over the world. For example, a GM might say: "This space station has a troublesome space-gang. What are they called?" and let the players name the gang.

I don't like this. When the going gets tough, the GM will demand that players solve problems through their characters' actions, not by making stuff up. Letting players make up things at other times is inconsistent.

However, I wish I'd given the players more in-character opportunities to change the world.

Here's an example from The Vampire Diaries. (Spoilers for TVD season 2.) In the show, "The Sun and The Moon Curse" was a spell that affected all vampires and werewolves. The curse made vampires burn in sunlight -- before the curse, they could walk by day. The curse also made werewolves change only on the full moon -- before the curse, they could change (or not change) whenever they wanted.

Here's the cool part (still spoilers): the curse can be broken, but only half of it will break. Either the vampires' sun curse or the werewolves' moon curse will end, while the other curse will remain forever.

Imagine if your players were able to make this choice in the first episode of the game. It's a huge decision with permanent consequences. For the rest of the season, you could bring in characters who were affected by that choice. This would constantly remind the players that their actions matter.

Something to try next time :)

### Highlights

I've focussed a lot on what went wrong. Here are two moments that the players enjoyed most:

#### The Glasses Store

The players wanted to kill a demon, who had taken the form of a barista at Starbucks. They learned that the demon could control anyone who made eye contact with it.

The player characters (PCs) decided to protect their eyes with $10 sunglasses from the convenience store across the road from Starbucks. But one of the PCs said she was too stylish to wear $10 sunnies, and left the group to buy expensive sunglasses instead.

I cut to the divergent PC in the glasses store, and had one of the villain's henchmen confront her there. He told her to give up and back off, etc. In response, she attacked him, overpowered him, and forced him to reveal some crucial details of the evil plan.

All of the players seemed to love this scene, even though most of them weren't in it!

I don't know why, but I can guess. When that player made their character storm off to a glasses store, they were just messing around. They didn't expect anything real to happen there, and when the scene ended up being _crucial to the plot_, I think it felt a bit magic.

Or it might have just been that we played the scene well. It's a lot easier with only two people, rather than the whole group.

#### The Rooftop

![the artifact shattered into a thousand pieces over the floor](/journal/images/2016-02-16-shattered.jpg)

The players destroyed a magical artifact that was essential to the villain's plan -- and my plan for the story.

The artifact was on a tripod near the edge of a rooftop. The player trying to deactivate it rolled "succeed with a cost". I did not want it to fall off the roof, but when I saw the dice, I _knew_ it had to happen. The rooftop edge was Chekhov's gun. Only one outcome made narrative sense.

The artifact fell to the ground and smashed into a thousand tiny pieces. I didn't manage to hide the fact that the players had just broken the story, and I had no idea what would happen next. Apparently, this made it more exciting!

### Goals

How did I go with those initial goals?

#### 1. A short campaign

I said we'd end after 5 episodes, and we did. But it was rough. In the final episode, I cut out every subplot, frantically trying to get to the conclusion in time. NPCs inexplicably stopped fighting and agreed to work together. People who were on their way never showed up. The quieter players were sidelined as the loudest ones pushed towards the end.

I actually enjoyed it, because I've seen final episodes on real TV shows do the same thing -- to me, it was very TV-authentic. But it wasn't so good for the players. I tried to do a dramatic cliffhanger ending but the players, having much less context than I did, found it a lot bleaker than I intended.

(They thought they had ended the world! Actually, they'd saved it, by stopping the true villain, with only a minor complication of letting a gigantic demon go free. But I'd never explained what the villain's evil plan was, so they didn't know that they'd narrowly avoided an apocalypse.)

And this is probably inevitable, but I thought up a much better final line 10 minutes later. Arg!

#### 2. A super fast plot

We had our moments, but I made a mistake in not giving the players a clear plan of what to do, and tying the evil plot actions to specific events that were days apart.

#### 3. Minimum planning

I'm proud of how this went. I had a list of NPCs (each with a secret), a list of magical locations and an evil plan. It didn't take long to make and it meant I always had something to reveal.

At one point I 'cast' the NPCs by giving them each a photo from Google Image Search. This was easy and fun.

#### 4. Total player freedom

Didn't work right. The players needed a clearer idea of what they were supposed to do. I'd also like them to see the impact of their actions on the world, starting from the very first episode.

### So

Overall, it was a rough and messy campaign, but it had some great moments and I learned a lot.

Although I didn't achieve all my goals, I am pleased with the goals themselves -- I'm happy to keep working towards the perfect "short, fast-paced, improvised story with total player freedom".
