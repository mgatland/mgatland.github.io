Things happening in my life:

### Game Number Four

My fourth one-week game was a collaboration with Jonathan, who was taking a break from his work on Path of Exile.

The game's not quite ready to release, but here is a screenshot:

Coming soon!

### End of Deadline Club.

The Deadline Club was a weekly meeting where people worked on personal projects. I ran the club with Alice Gatland (my sister), and sometimes Helen Durrant and Amie Holman.

We decided to shut down the club, and focus our time and attention onto other projects. 

It was the first time I've organised a regular event, and I learned a lot. We had 20 meetings in total. I'm a little sad to see it end, but definitely ready to move on to something new.

### Raymond E. Feist

Raymond E. Feist gave a talk at the Central Auckland Library on the 19th of June. (He's a fantasy author.)

He was a great speaker, very confident and comfortable and sure of himself. It makes sense: he's been a well-known author for over 30 years.

Raymond said that writing can create a strange, one-sided dialogue. There are people today who are reading and reacting to words he published in 1982. Most of the time, he never hears their reaction.

### Winter of Code

In the BizDojo Co.Space (the same venue we used for the Deadline Club) there's a new table set up with six computers. Here, Stephen McIntyre is leading a team of programmers and artists to make a game.

The project happens during the break between semesters at the Media Design School, so that the MDS students are on holiday and can participate.

I love the idea. I stopped in to see how they were going, and everyone on the team seemed excited and motivated.

I would like to run something similar for myself some day -- maybe targeting students from the University of Auckland instead.
