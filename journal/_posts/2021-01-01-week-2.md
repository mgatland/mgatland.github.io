title: Winter thoughts - 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;6

Whoops, these were supposed to be weekly. It's been a month since the last one. That's OK.

I'm coming up to the end of a three-week holiday. I didn't do much except sleep, and that's OK too.

The best thing about this holiday is that I stopped thinking about work. I was thinking about work a lot. I would often wake up in the middle of the night and send myself an email because I had an Important Work Thought.

I don't want to do that any more. 2021: the year of not working as much.

I listened to an episode of the [Eggplant podcast](https://thespelunkyshowlike.libsyn.com/) where they interviewed Chevy Ray Johnston about his magic school game Ikenfell. I like magic school settings and have an unfinished magic school game of my own, so I was keen to listen.

It's a great interview, with some interesting ideas on how to balance special abilities vs normal damage-dealing attacks. But most importantly, Chevy recommended two magic school stories: the novel [Carry On](https://www.rainbowrowell.com/carry-on) and the web series [Carmilla](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbvYWjKFvS5rX2yv-k5AJ8oxPoZ9zHcpe). I started watching the web series today. It's fun!

I watched a lot of TV this year. If I'm going to continue watching a lot of TV, I wonder if I can make better choices about what to watch.

A lot of the shows I watch don't really give me much in return for my time. I watched every episode of Star Trek: Discovery and I don't remember any episode that "spoke to me" or made me feel something. Same with Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, which dropped a new season yesterday. I'm going to watch it anyway, but I'm not sure why?

Maybe trying to make my TV habits _enriching_ is missing the point. I don't know. I don't want to overthink my hobbies and turn them into jobs. But I also don't want to spend a thousand hours watching bad TV if watching good TV would leave me feeling better.
