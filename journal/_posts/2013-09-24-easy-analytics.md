Tide was mentioned on [indiegames.com](http://indiegames.com/2013/09/browser_pick_tide.html). The link brought a few hundred visitors â€” more than I've ever had before.

I wanted to see what these new players were doing in the game, so I added some event tracking code.

### Code corner

If your page already uses Google Analytics, tracking events in JavaScript is easy. All you need to do is add a function like this:

    var track = function (action, label, val) {
      console.log("tracked: " + action + ", " + label + ", " + val);
      try {
        //Replace "Tide" with your game's name
        _gaq.push(['_trackEvent',"Tide", action, ""+label, val]);
      } catch (e) {
      }
    }

I use the action to describe what happened (e.g. the player won a level) and the label to give additional information, like what level the player was.

    track("lose", level);

(I don't currently use the third argument.)

Warning: What I'm doing might not be best practice! I'm just a beginner with Google Analytics.

### The results

![Screenshot of data discussed below](/journal/images/2013-09-30-tide-overview.png)

The Unique Events column ignores repeated events from the same computer. This is useful when you want to count individual people.

The _newgame_ column shows that 473 different people started the game.

438 people won at least one level. That's good; it means most people tried the game and worked out the controls.

375 people lost at least once. This leaves nearly 100 players (21%) who quit before they lost. That surprised me, because I thought most players would keep playing until they lost.

We'll look at the _consecutivegames_ event in a moment.

First, lets see how many levels people are playing.

![Level 2 was reached 738 times. The numbers drop off for higher levels. Level 16 and 17 were only reached once.](/journal/images/2013-09-30-tide-level-stats.png)

The first column is the level number. The second column shows how many times that level was reached. (Ignore the percentage at the end; it's not meaningful.)

Fewer people reached higher levels, as expected. The highest level reached was level 17.

Next, let's look at how many times players restarted the game after losing.

![There were 203 restarts after losing once, 83 after losing twice, 33 after losing 3 times. The numbers decrease rapidly.](/journal/images/2013-09-30-tide-restart-stats.png)

The first column is the number of times the player has already lost. The second column is how many people restarted (instead of quitting) at that point.

Most players didn't restart any games at all (which isn't shown on this graph). About 200 restarted after their first loss, and the numbers decrease rapidly. Five dedicated players played 10 games before quitting.

### What's next?

I thought Tide was a hard, arcade style game that people would replay to try to improve their high score.

However, that's not happening. Most people only play once.

If players only want to play once, maybe I should make Tide progress more like a modern-style game:

* When you lose, you restart the current level instead of going back to the start of the game
* There is a limited number of levels
* Levels are hand-made, not random, and more interesting
* When you finish all the levels you get a nice victory screen.

On the other hand, I could try to make Tide into a better arcade style game:

* Make it much harder, so new players lose in the first few seconds
* Show the player's score more clearly
* Have a high score table.
