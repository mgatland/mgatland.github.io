It's not a prestigious mod collection. The server's custom config is full of fart jokes and dick jokes, the maps are chaotic and tiny and far too frantic to use my gun the way it was meant to be used. But it's amazing that this thing I made is still out there, long after I stopped paying attention.

What else is floating around the internet?
