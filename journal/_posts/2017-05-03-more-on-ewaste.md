title: More on e-waste
---

I'm sorry I'm writing about e-waste again. Throwing out my old computer stuff has been surprisingly emotional. Especially this:

I bought this case after I moved to Auckland. I wanted a gaming computer, and gaming laptops were much too expensive, so it had to be a desktop. But I also knew I would be moving it around a lot -- back to my parents' house in all my university breaks. I researched the best affordable lightweight PC case there was, and this was it:

They didn't make them any more, but I found one second-hand on TradeMe. I picked it up from a fellow nerd and carried it home on foot and bus with its [cute carry-handle](http://techreport.com/review/4771/antec-lanboy-case/4){:target="_blank"}.

Since then, me and my Lanboy had heaps of travel adventures. As well as holidays at my parents' house, I moved flat at least once a year for many years.

By the time I built my next computer, life had settled down -- and I had a laptop to take on shorter trips. I bought a heavier, more spacious case and Lanboy retired to the corner of my bedroom.

Today I took him to the e-waste place. I feel a little guilty. I could have continued the legacy by handing him on to a new young nerd. I doubt the e-waste people will appreciate his value, except as scrap aluminium.

But he wasn't having much fun gathering dust in my room. I'm sure this is all for the best.
