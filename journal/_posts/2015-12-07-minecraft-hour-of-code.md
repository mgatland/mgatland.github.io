Today I joined a team of people from OMG Tech!, Code Club and Microsoft to run [Hour of Code](https://code.org/mc) events at four schools around Auckland. It was an intense day!

We used the new Minecraft-flavoured Hour of Code activity. After seeing lots of children try the activity, I have some feedback. I couldn't find any way to get feedback to code.org, so I'm putting it here in the hopes it will somehow be useful for someone.

So:

I like the minecraft activity a lot. I think it's the best code.org activity so far, for two reasons:

* The character moves much faster. This means it doesn't take as long to execute your code and see whether it works. I think this makes mistakes less frustrating as there's less waiting involved. (The tradeoff is that it may be harder to follow exactly what's happening.)
* The activities provide room for extension and creativity. For example, in an activity where you are planting crops, you can optionally shear some nearby sheep as an extra challenge.

However, I also noticed some problems or just surprises:

* Many students skipped the instruction videos. This means the challenges should not assume any knowledge from the video.
* Many students do not read the level objective text. This is most noticable when they reach level 9 and get stuck. The level is not difficult; it's just hard to guess the objective by looking at it. It might help if the instructions were more visual -- a bullet-point list instead of a paragraph, or using icons instead of words where possible.
* It can be hard to tell which way the character is facing. They look very similar when facing North and South.
* The failure screen can be frustrating. Many students take a few attempts to get the right solution, making changes after each test run. It's discouraging that the activity responds to each of these test runs as if the player failed, when they may actually be making steady progress towards their goal.
* The character moves with commands 'move forward', 'turn left' and 'turn right'. Many students struggle with the concept of turning left and right, and it takes a lot of attention for something that's not actually a computer science concept. I would be interested in seeing a version that used 'look Up' \ 'look Down' \ 'look Left' \ 'look Right' instead, to test whether it would be easier for students and help them spend more energy on the coding concepts.

These are all minor issues. Most students had no trouble with the activity, and almost everyone was excited about the Minecraft setting. The special effects on some levels were great -- I remember students particularly pleased when they built the wall around their house and the interior magically appeared inside.
