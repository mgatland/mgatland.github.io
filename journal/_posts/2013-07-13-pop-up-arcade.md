[Gather](http://gathergather.co.nz/) is an unconference held in Auckland every year.

This year, Alice, Amie and I used ten laptops to set up a pop-up arcade.

Thank you to everyone who came! We hope you had fun and saw something new. Super thank you to everyone who loaned their computer.

All of the games were made by Auckland developers. The games were:
