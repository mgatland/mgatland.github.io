Hey! I haven't released a game for a while. What did I do all month?

### The Pop-Up Games Arcade

* Started planning a day-long pop-up event.
* Found a cool venue.
* Bought laptops from facebook friends and TradeMe sellers.
* Painted a laptop! I was scared at first, but I grew braver.

### Turned down a job

A lecturer offered me some contract work, building a game for her and the university. This was a great opportunity, but was it right for me?

<!--
Making some money from game dev would be great. I haven't earned any money since I quit my day job.

And having a client would force me back into good work habits, like waking up before midday :/

On the other hand, all the game developers I know who do contract work seem to wish that they didn't. If they could afford to work on their own IP, they would.
-->

At Webstock this year, Jim Coudal said "fire your clients!" His company fired its clients one-by-one until there were none left. Now they work only own their own projects.

I can already afford to work on my own projects, which is what I really want to do. Taking on a client is not a step towards that goal.

<!--
And while it might help me develop good working habits, it's also going to occupy my time for many months until the contract is over.-->

In the end, I turned down the job — recommending some friends instead.

### Other things

* Joined a creative community called Scribble, and helped decorate a nightclub for an event. I was brought on board to help with software, but ended up cutting out [cardboard triangles](http://www.1885.co.nz/images/uploads/gallery/TTT7.jpg) — a refreshing change from my usual work.
* Went to the first KiwiJam game jam. My favourite game was [Pianocalypse: Blasphemous Resurrection](http://gamejolt.com/games/action/pianocalypse-blasphemous-resurrection/17323/).
* Saw my sister's first improv performance!
* Saw the [100 Days Project](http://100daysproject.co.nz/about) exhibition. It was inspirational seeing so many proud creatives with their work.
* Taught web development at another [Gather workshop](http://gathergather.co.nz/workshops/for-schools/), this time at Westlake Girls High School. At the end of the day, the students uploaded their websites to Neocities and linked to each other. This was super-fun, and reminded me of the websites I was making [when I was their age](http://www.geocities.ws/dragonflymatthew/index2.htm).
