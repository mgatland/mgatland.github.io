    	<h2>Rewriting Takedown</h2>
    	<div class="subtle">August&nbsp;05,&nbsp;2013</div>
    </div>
    
<p>I wrote Takedown while I was at high school.</p>
<p>It only worked in Windows. These days, I often don’t have a Windows computer nearby. I thought it would be fun to rewrite the game in Javascript, so that it can run on anything.</p>
<h3 id="what-went-right">What went right</h3>
<p>It <em>was</em> fun rewriting my old code. It was a bit like peer-programming with my younger self – a person who was endlessly enthusiastic, though extremely inexperienced.</p>
<p>Reusing old assets and content led to some satisfying moments of rapid progress – like when I got the level loader working, and suddenly had 10 levels to play with.</p>
<h3 id="changing-things">Changing things</h3>
<p>Initially, I wanted the new version to be identical to the original. It uses the original art, sound effects, levels and storyline.</p>
<p>But I did allow a few changes. The original control scheme was terrible; you could move in any direction, and fired in the whatever direction you last moved in, unless you were holding shift which locked your rotation – it was complicated and no-one liked it.</p>
<p>I replaced those controls with a 2-stick shooter style setup where your movement direction and attack direction are independent.</p>
<p>I also couldn’t resist fixing spelling mistakes, making the hardest missions easier, and adding autosave. Do you remember when games didn’t autosave? It wasn’t just me and Takedown – even the triple-A games of the time didn’t have autosave.</p>
<p>Despite the autosave, it still mostly looks and feels like a Visual Basic game from 2002 by a 16-year-old.</p>
<p>Cool! That was the goal.</p>
<h3 id="what-went-wrong">What went wrong</h3>
<p>It took a <em>really</em> long time.</p>
<p>After a week, I started to feel depressed. <em>Why am I doing this? This isn’t helping my business. This isn’t making me a better designer.</em></p>
<p>My younger self added a lot of features to Takedown. If I’m 10 times faster, I’m also 12 times less patient. I left out any feature that wasn’t used in the main campaign – then also left out a few that were used.</p>
<p>This means the Javascript game will never be a full remake of the original game. The missing features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weapon upgrades</li>
<li>Being able to order your teammates to follow you around</li>
<li>Enemies say things like “Good shot!” or “Follow me” to each other</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scripting">Scripting</h3>
<p>I made the new game compatible with the <a href="https://github.com/mgatland/takedown/blob/cbee0ef23787000dc3df97391a1d0893412b33d2/web/res/01.tdm">original mission file format</a>. This forced me to support all my old ideas about mission scripting.</p>
<p>For example, there’s no concept of a collectable item in Takedown. Instead, you simulate it as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>place a non-interactive item-shaped decoration on the ground.</li>
<li>add a trigger that fires when the player steps in the same square as the decoration.</li>
<li>The trigger sets a flag (saved between levels), hides the decoration, and pops up a “mission briefing” which says “You found an item!”</li>
<li>Actually, a trigger can only perform 2 actions, so you’ll need 2 triggers to do all that.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s cool that the new game supports the original mission files. But if I rewrote the mission scripts, I could get rid of a lot of awkward scripting hacks.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>I’m happy that Takedown lives on the internet now and everyone (who uses Chrome) can play it.</p>
<p>I feel guilty about spending so much time on this, and embarrassed that I don’t have any other new games to show people.</p>
<p>But maybe there’s an audience out there somewhere who will discover this game and enjoy it. Maybe people who are nostalgic about awkward, early Windows games?</p>
<p>(Whatever happened to Comet Busters, anyway?)</p>
