<p>At last month’s <a href="http://www.meetup.com/playmaker/">game dev meetup</a>, I was about to go full-time indie. Everyone said congratulations and I had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>But this month was even better, because everyone said: It’s been a month; what have you done? And I showed them my games, and they gave lots of feedback.</p>
<p>I don’t always agree with the feedback. But I note it anyway, knowing that I might agree with it tomorrow.</p>
<hr>
<p>Chris W asked why I’m making one-week games. What’s the business plan? How will this turn into money?</p>
<p>Good question. I don’t know how it will turn into money.</p>
<p>But most of the indies I admire have released a lot of games; the plan is to be like them… I’ll find money later.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m making a simple multiplayer game – more like a chatroom – using node.js, with websockets.</p>
<p>I thought I could host it on Heroku, but I found out today <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs">from a beautiful tutorial</a> that websockets are not supported.</p>
<p>(A competing service, <a href="http://nodester.com/">Nodester</a>, offered websocket support, but they were acquired by AppFog and shut down. The <a href="http://blog.nodester.com/post/30434216604/nodester-joins-appfog">blog post</a> about the acquisition specifically mentions Nodester’s websocket support, as if AppFog were eager to incorporate that technology into their own product, but they haven’t yet. Frustrating.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the beautiful Heroku tutorial also told me that in the node world, it’s best practice to <a href="http://www.futurealoof.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html">check your dependencies into source control</a>.</p>
<p>That’s the opposite of what I learned working in enterprise Java – but it’s an appealing idea, based on the principle of making development environments and production environments as similar as possible. No surprises when you deploy. Now I’m reading <a href="http://www.12factor.net/dependencies">The Twelve Factor App</a> to see what other new ideas I can find.</p>
