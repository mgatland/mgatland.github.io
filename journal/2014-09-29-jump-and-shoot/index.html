<p>I showed Space Protector at Digital Nationz yesterday. Here’s me trying to look approachable:</p>
<p><img src="/journal/images/2014-09-28-matthew-at-digital-nationz.jpg" alt="my Space Protector booth at Digital Nationz"></p>
<p>I gave players a gamepad which worked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/journal/images/2014-09-29-space-protector-gamepad.jpg" alt="D-pad moves left and right, X jumps, Square shoots. Those are the only actions."></p>
<p>I didn’t tell people what the controls were. To my immense surprise, <em>many players never realised that you can shoot</em>.</p>
<p>That’s right: in my four-button game, some players never found the fourth button.</p>
<h3 id="but-my-design-was-perfect">But my design was perfect…</h3>
<p>In the screenshot below, the player is blocked by two enemies. The enemies do not move, and touching them kills the player. The only way past is to shoot them.</p>
<p><img src="/journal/images/2014-09-29-you-must-shoot.png" alt="You must shoot to progress"></p>
<p>This scene makes sure the player knows how to shoot before they can proceed. It should force them to learn to shoot.</p>
<p>However, when the non-shooting players reached this scene, they didn’t start looking for the shoot button. Instead, they got stuck. One asked “Do I need to get a key?”</p>
<p>I could use a pop-up message saying “Press Square to shoot!” but that’s lazy design. It’s like putting a “pull” sticker on a door – a well designed door does not instructions.</p>
<p>Why are players getting stuck, instead of pressing the shoot button?</p>
<h3 id="a-theory">A theory</h3>
<p><img src="/journal/images/2014-09-29-space-protector-start.png" alt="path to the shoot test"></p>
<p>By the time players reach the place where they <em>have to</em> shoot, they have already passed a variety of obstacles.</p>
<p>They have already passed five enemies, so they assume they’ve mastered the controls and don’t need to try any new buttons.</p>
<p>If I’m right, moving the shoot test earlier will fix the problem. Players will be forced to learn to shoot while they’re still unsure of the controls.</p>
<p>Here’s a new shoot test, at the start of the level:</p>
<p><img src="/journal/images/2014-09-29-new-space-protector-start.png" alt="path to the shoot test"></p>
<p>I tried this change at Digital Nationz and I think it worked. (It’s hard to be sure, since not all users were affected anyway.)</p>
<p>Of course, there are many other possible solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show the controls at the start of the game</li>
<li>Have a pop-up message that says “press Square to shoot!”</li>
<li>Draw a big gun on the player sprite, so players assume they can shoot</li>
<li>Show a cutscene before the game that demonstrates the player’s abilities</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is easy to solve, but the trick was knowing that there was a problem at all. It’s really hard to predict how “normal gamers” will play your game.</p>
<p>Running playtests is my favourite part of game development. The whole reason I make games is so people can enjoy them.</p>
<p>As well as this lesson, I also learned a lot about what players find fun, frustrating, and funny. Analytics are great, but seeing people play your game in person is the most rewarding and useful thing you can do.</p>
