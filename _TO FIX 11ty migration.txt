Work to do:
[x] code highlighting 
[x] then i'm ready to ship 
[x] fix looseleafgames archive urls being broken

[ ] need to check all RSS feeds and make sure I haven't messed up the formatting of ampersands in particular
[ ] 11ty displays dates in my local timezone, messing everything up by 2 hours. There's some documentation on how to fix it. It's gross though!
[ ] use a subfolder for source, so I don't have to spefically ignore files like .gitignore

[ ] Cache node_modules like so: https://gist.github.com/rupeshtiwari/44ebec690f2c01bf1df9b1d215a0e723
[ ] takedown... center it on screen. Make the buttons more traditional Windows XP-looking. Maybe add a windows XP window around it.
[ ] move my game .zips and .exes somewhere else... that will speed up the build process a lot.
    maybe a new assets repository.
    i already have one called 'files'
        add /games/ and put the installers there.

[ ] I have added many files that contain this:
    "permalink": "{{ page.filePathStem }}.html" }
    But it's possible that I can set this at the top level for all folders instead of hand-setting it in each.
    And override it in journal, but maybe nowhere else?
    Some other examples of permalink may disappear too. I have some inconsistencies here.
    including ones in non json format, so search for peramlink without quotes 

[ ] I have had to set 'layout: null' in many index.html files.
    I want to make this the default for html files. Maybe! Check.

[x] static files... maybe fixed.
[x] fixed the footer \ breadcrumbs
[x] lots of small markdown incompatibilities. Maybe fix case-by-case.
