Differences:

[ ] code highlighting 
[ ] then i'm ready to ship 
[ ] fix looseleafgames archive urls 
[ ] separate source/processed and static folders a bit better

[ ] 11ty displays dates in my local timezone, messing everything up by 2 hours. There's some documentation on how to fix it. It's gross though!
[ ] need to check all RSS feeds and make sure I haven't messed up the formatting of ampersands in particular

[ ] I have added many files that contain this:
    "permalink": "{{ page.filePathStem }}.html" }
    But it's possible that I can set this at the top level for all folders instead of hand-setting it in each.
    And override it in journal, but maybe nowhere else?
    Some other examples of permalink may disappear too 
    including ones in non json format, so search for peramlink without quotes 

[ ] I have had to set 'layout: null' in many index.html files.
    I want to make this the default for html files. Maybe! Check.

[x] static files... maybe fixed.
[x] fixed the footer \ breadcrumbs
[x] lots of small markdown incompatibilities. Maybe fix case-by-case.
