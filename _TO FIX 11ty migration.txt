Differences:

[ ] I have added many files that contain this:
    "permalink": "{{ page.filePathStem }}.html" }
    But it's possible that I can set this at the top level for all files.
    And override it in journal, but maybe nowhere else?
    Some other examples of permalink may disappear too 
    including ones in non json format, so search for peramlink without quotes 

[ ] I have had to set 'layout: null' in many index.html files.
    I want to make this the default for html files. Maybe! Check.

[x] static files... maybe fixed.
[x] fixed the footer \ breadcrumbs
[x] lots of small markdown incompatibilities. Maybe fix case-by-case.

[ ] code formatting, in several blog posts.
[ ] misc folders, not games or journal 
[ ] the games homepage... then we're pretty close
