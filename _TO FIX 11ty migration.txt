Priorities:

[ ] add 100day games to the main series.
[ ] make sure the old links stay as permalinks
    https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/510#issuecomment-824104799
    This is how i'm going to do the redirects for old URLs.
    Do this for /writing/ as well.

    Wait... I should probably use cloudflare bulk redirects instead.
    https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/create-dashboard/
    it's a shame to have 2 places to do this but i could store the config file in the repo so it's still kinda together. 

filtering:
add
quality: high | medium | low 
requirements: web (keyboard + mouse) | web (touch) | download | other
development time: days | weeks | years 

// there's an example here to filter a collection by the original file extension i.e. '.md' https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/

game screenshots could grow to 250x250 like increpare 
his games have dates attached, and icons for the platform 

my games page could probably lose its max-width restriction and go full screen. A full screen of games.

(except for the footer)

I could improve the filtering.
I could add little icons above the games for where it's playable:
    browser computer 
    browser phone 
    downloadable
    N/A

I can get rid of the concept of 'order' and use dates as order... but I want to update some of the dates if I do this.
Or have two dates, the 'first published' and 'last updated'

Add neptune-9 old back into the series.

The filters could be a little list of 'on/off' toggles 
they could be black text on a grey background with rounded corners and no background (like 'tags' on stackoverflow etc)

good games | ok games | bad games
download | browser (keyboard) | browser (phone) | misc 

maybe star ratings is the best technicque 

some art reference:
    https://sv.wordpress.org/plugins/tags/rate/
    for the grey icons at the bottom 

Dashicons (from Wordpress)
    browser | cloud or laptop
    phone | smartphone
    download | download (maybe combined with laptop)
    misc | help or universal access or users or site (it's a globe)

    Quality icons:
    good | awards

    bad | trash 
    

    or I could use 'star filled' and 'star empty' to do 3 stars, 2 stars, 1 star







=====================


Work to do:
[x] code highlighting 
[x] then i'm ready to ship 
[x] fix looseleafgames archive urls being broken

[ ] need to check all RSS feeds and make sure I haven't messed up the formatting of ampersands in particular
[ ] 11ty displays dates in my local timezone, messing everything up by 2 hours. There's some documentation on how to fix it. It's gross though!
[ ] use a subfolder for source, so I don't have to spefically ignore files like .gitignore

[ ] Cache node_modules like so: https://gist.github.com/rupeshtiwari/44ebec690f2c01bf1df9b1d215a0e723
[ ] takedown... center it on screen. Make the buttons more traditional Windows XP-looking. Maybe add a windows XP window around it.
[ ] move my game .zips and .exes somewhere else... that will speed up the build process a lot.
    maybe a new assets repository.
    i already have one called 'files'
        add /games/ and put the installers there.

[ ] I have added many files that contain this:
    "permalink": "{{ page.filePathStem }}.html" }
    But it's possible that I can set this at the top level for all folders instead of hand-setting it in each.
    And override it in journal, but maybe nowhere else?
    Some other examples of permalink may disappear too. I have some inconsistencies here.
    including ones in non json format, so search for peramlink without quotes 

[ ] I have had to set 'layout: null' in many index.html files.
    I want to make this the default for html files. Maybe! Check.

[x] static files... maybe fixed.
[x] fixed the footer \ breadcrumbs
[x] lots of small markdown incompatibilities. Maybe fix case-by-case.
