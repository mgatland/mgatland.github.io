Priorities:

post-release (of the new filter and stuff) cleanup:
[ ] on rockstormers 100day page i must credit the influence of [Comet Bumper](https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/ultimate-cat-drift-comet-bumpers-bananacontra).
    only if the timing makes sense 
[ ] ahh https://flappyworld.mgatland.com/ is down. fix it 
[ ] maybe bump flappyworld out of 'bad' into 'good' if it's not too bad.
[ ] tweet about this... the filter, the games, the journal post. Perhaps a non-backdated journal post about the new filter and this whole project.

permalink and redirect:
    http://www.matthewgatland.com/ggj2018/


[ ] replace it with a backdated blog post 
[ ] and a current blogpost about the new filter.

[ ] update the chain game page with a link to https://experiment26.itch.io/experiment26

post-release cleanup:
[ ] fix Vampire Tanks touch controls. The positioning is not right.
[ ] make Follower and 90 mile beach touch controls work on press instead of when finger is lifted.
[ ] remove sortByOrder from the XML.
[ ] fix Tide... it's broken.
[ ] add my first global game jam game, war dance
[ ] consider porting some old games to js. Like the original Cerulean, it's nice.
[ ] do chromasia
[ ] do other old games 
[ ] port Space Octopus Mono? Both versions?

[] use redirects to get rid of the old /writing/ page as well.  
    Wait... I should probably use cloudflare bulk redirects instead.
    https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/create-dashboard/
    it's a shame to have 2 places to do this but i could store the config file in the repo so it's still kinda together. 

=====================

Work to do:
[x] code highlighting 
[x] then i'm ready to ship 
[x] fix looseleafgames archive urls being broken

[ ] need to check all RSS feeds and make sure I haven't messed up the formatting of ampersands in particular
[ ] 11ty displays dates in my local timezone, messing everything up by 2 hours. There's some documentation on how to fix it. It's gross though!
[ ] use a subfolder for source, so I don't have to spefically ignore files like .gitignore

[ ] Cache node_modules like so: https://gist.github.com/rupeshtiwari/44ebec690f2c01bf1df9b1d215a0e723
[ ] takedown... center it on screen. Make the buttons more traditional Windows XP-looking. Maybe add a windows XP window around it.
[ ] move my game .zips and .exes somewhere else... that will speed up the build process a lot.
    maybe a new assets repository.
    i already have one called 'files'
        add /games/ and put the installers there.

[ ] I have added many files that contain this:
    "permalink": "{{ page.filePathStem }}.html" }
    But it's possible that I can set this at the top level for all folders instead of hand-setting it in each.
    And override it in journal, but maybe nowhere else?
    Some other examples of permalink may disappear too. I have some inconsistencies here.
    including ones in non json format, so search for peramlink without quotes 

[ ] I have had to set 'layout: null' in many index.html files.
    I want to make this the default for html files. Maybe! Check.

[x] static files... maybe fixed.
[x] fixed the footer \ breadcrumbs
[x] lots of small markdown incompatibilities. Maybe fix case-by-case.

flash game pages are completely gone?

2023-07-12

[x] add 100day games to the main series.
    [x] add the intro pages
    [x] check the development times of each game and add to their page.
    [x] fix the ordering problems for the last two games and maybe another two that share a date.
    [x] add the /play/ pages 
        [x] these all need to be configured with layout: none
        [x] maybe I can remove the default layout for games pages so it defaults to none. Seems to be set manually for all the pages that need it.
        [x] I've checked and it looks like every page that should have layout: normal has it explicitely set (in the games/ folder)
    [x] check mobile support is correctly tagged on all one-day games

    [x] the filter buttons... I think they should all be radio buttons except the star ratings.
        [x] this created an issue where you can't turn a filter off again once it's on. Maybe change back to checkboxes and javascript uncheck the others.
        [x] now they are semi-radio buttons that can be turned off again 
        [x] add ballot-box ticks to the star ratings so you can see that they are checkboxes, not radio buttons 
        [no] this could haev been a double-ended discrete slider! would have been cool? maybe not. 

[x] do a pass on the quality ratings in 100days
[x] do quality pass for all the games, not only the 100days ones. 
[x] add event labels 
    [x] anti-patreon 
    [x] ludum dare 
    [x] global game jam 
[x] quality pass: not sure if 'said so' deserves to be highlighted. [no] Also wonder if 'service' could be instead.
[x] 'best' should only be games that I'd be happy being the only game of mine you see. One chance games.
[x] 'bad' should be games that are not worth trying even if you're fairly interested in me as a creator. It shouldn't have notable bad games. Only bland bad games.

[nope] I think Cerulean or its chain game sequel might deserve to be in 'best'
[x] 'bad' games: bump Return to Happytown out of there, it's a different kind of bad.

before release:
[x] remove 100days multipage
[x] add the '100days home page' somewhere... as a backdated journal post.
[x] remove the old 100days github pages site
[x] add redirects from the old URLs to new ones (including /100days/)

[x] filtering:
    add
    quality: high | medium | low 
    requirements: web (keyboard + mouse) | web (touch) | download | other
    development time: days | weeks | years 
[x] my games page could probably lose its max-width restriction and go full screen. A full screen of games.
[x] I can get rid of the concept of 'order' and use dates as order... but I want to update some of the dates if I do this. Or have two dates, the 'first published' and 'last updated'

// there's an example here to filter a collection by the original file extension i.e. '.md' https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/

game screenshots could grow to 250x250 like increpare 
his games have dates attached, and icons for the platform 

(except for the footer)

I could improve the filtering.
I could add little icons above the games for where it's playable:
    browser computer 
    browser phone 
    downloadable
    N/A

Add neptune-9 old back into the series.

[x] The filters could be a little list of 'on/off' toggles 
[x] they could be black text on a grey background with rounded corners and no background (like 'tags' on stackoverflow etc)
    good games | ok games | bad games
    download | browser (keyboard) | browser (phone) | misc 
    maybe star ratings is the best technicque 
    some art reference:
    https://sv.wordpress.org/plugins/tags/rate/
    for the grey icons at the bottom 

Dashicons (from Wordpress)
    browser | cloud or laptop
    phone | smartphone
    download | download (maybe combined with laptop)
    misc | help or universal access or users or site (it's a globe)

    Quality icons:
    good | awards
    bad | trash 
    
    or I could use 'star filled' and 'star empty' to do 3 stars, 2 stars, 1 star
