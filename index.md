[Space Octopus Mono](/games/som/) is probably my best. I've shown it at several events, where you'll often find couples or a parent and child playing together.

![Pop-Up Arcade](/images/pop-up-arcade.jpg){:.w640}

I run a [Pop-Up Arcade](http://popuparcade.co.nz) with two friends. We show a collection of DIY videogames from the local community. 

It's a fun, inclusive event. Most of our audience don't see themselves as gamers, but find that they love playing games in a friendly environment.

I make a few non-digital games. These photos are from an elaborate party game adventure that I co-created with my sister.

I've worked on other interactive experiences, including Mysterious Stranger's [Frequency](http://www.mysterious-stranger.co.nz/frequency/) in 2014.

![Teaching Scratch for FutureInTech](/images/workshops-futureintech.jpg)

Between projects, I visit schools to teach programming and promote technology careers. This is volunteer work organised by [Gather](http://gathergather.co.nz/workshops/) and [FutureInTech](http://www.futureintech.org.nz/).

New Zealand software companies provide great jobs, but are facing a huge skill shortage. Making students aware of the opportunities can help them into a great career, and help the industry keep growing.

<!-- A talk at Mount Roskill Grammar School (ICT-Connect), Scratch workshop at Ponsonby Primary School (FutureInTech), a talk at Glendowie College (FIT), and gather workshops at Tamaki College, Howick College, Mount Roskill Grammar School, Westlake Girls' High School, Okaihau College-->

I used to work at Orion Health with these amazing people:

![Orion Health](/images/orion-health.jpg){:.w640}

I mainly worked on a complex back-end system, but did other stuff over the years.

One of my favourite tasks was visiting a hospital to watch a nurse's pen-and-paper workflow. We were designing a digital system to take its place, and it was great to really understand what the problems were and how our product could make life easier.

![Deadline Club #4](/images/deadline-club.jpg){:.w640}

The Deadline Club was a place for busy people to get together and work.

We wanted to make a weekly meetup where you actually worked on your hobby projects, instead of just talking about them. The Deadline Club was something you could put on your calendar and know you'd get some work done.

It was the first time I'd helped run a regular event, and I learned a lot about venues, catering and promotion. The club has closed now but the skills I learned from DLC helped the Pop-Up Arcade get started.
