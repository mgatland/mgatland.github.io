[Space Octopus Mono](/games/som/) is probably my best. I've shown it at several events, where you'll often find couples or a parent and child playing together.

I run a [Pop-Up Arcade](http://popuparcade.co.nz) with two friends. We show a collection of DIY videogames from the local community. 

It's a fun, inclusive event. Most of our audience don't identify as gamers, but find that they love playing games in a friendly environment.

This photo is from an elaborate party game adventure that I co-created with my sister for her birthday.

![Alice's Birthday Game 2.0](/images/alices-birthday-game-2-map.jpg){:.w640}

The game started with sit-down activities like creating this map, but led to the players leaving the property to explore the city, solve puzzles in a park and catch a train.

I've worked on other interactive experiences, including Mysterious Stranger's [Frequency](http://www.mysterious-stranger.co.nz/frequency/) in 2014.

Between projects, I visit schools to teach programming and promote technology careers. This is volunteer work organised by [Gather](http://gathergather.co.nz/workshops/) and [FutureInTech](http://www.futureintech.org.nz/).

Many high school students don't know how big New Zealand's software sector is. There are so many vacancies right now that anyone who becomes good at IT is guaranteed a job.

Making students aware of the opportunities can help them make the best choice about their future.

<!-- Scratch workshop at Ponsonby Primary School (FutureInTech), a talk at Glendowie College (FIT), and gather workshops at Tamaki College, Howick College, Mount Roskill Grammar School, Westlake Girls' High School, Okaihau College-->

I'm self-employed, but I used to work at Orion Health with these amazing people:

Our projects ranged from tiny prototypes to massive back-end systems.

Google has interviewed me three times but never offered me a job. I've actually spent more time in Google interviews than in all other job interviews combined.

I like programming competitions, giving talks and teaching people. I also love the outdoors, although I rarely visit them.
