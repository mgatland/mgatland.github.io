Or after a blood test, the blood lab sends a message saying 'Here are Matthew Gatland's blood test results.'</aside>

				  <h1>What now?</h1>
				  <aside class="notes">There's a bug in the software. We can fix it in the next version. But hospitals are big organisations, they can be really slow - it might take 6 months before the hospital is ready to install a new version of the software on all their computers.
				  The doctors and nurses need the information in those messages right now, this morning.
				  So fixing the bug isn't enough - we need a quick fix.

			        2:40 AM &#8594; 2:04 AM<br>
			      </p>
			      <aside class="notes">We decide to hack the messages then send them in again. We'll change the times so they look like they come in the right sequence. I know it'll fix the issue because I know the code really well.<br>
			      But there's one problem.<br>
			      I'm not a doctor. Or a nurse. These messages contain clinical data - it could be life or death stuff. I can't just go changing messages around unless I know it's safe to do so.</aside>

			      <aside class="notes">Most importantly, the user. For one project, I was flown with my team to Canberra in Australia so we could actually watch a nurse go around taking blood samples out of people.<br>
			        To really see it happen gave us a whole lot of insights we never would have had before.
			        We're used to working with 2 screens, on big desks, all together in our office. But the nurse walks around a building with a trolley - if there's going to be a computer it has to fit on there - and it's already mostly full of blood stuff.
